# WHAT IS HACKADEMIA?
Hackademia is Southern Californiaâ€™s first hackathon by high schoolers, for high schoolers. Our aim is to help hundreds of student hackers in the Los Angeles area realize their greatest coding potential in a 24 hour coding competition. We ask all hackers to build the best they can-- both hardware and software-- within 24 hours.

## Wait, what's a hackathon?
A Hackathon is an event in which all sorts of hackers come together to innovative projects to solve real world problems, with additional prizes for projects tailored towards sponsors. Hackademia will provide all of the mentorship and food you need to create an amazing project. You can read more [here](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601).
