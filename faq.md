### What is Hackademia?
Hackademia is Southern California’s first hackathon by high schoolers, for high schoolers. Our aim is to help hundreds of student hackers in the Los Angeles area realize their greatest coding potential in a 24 hour coding competition. We ask all hackers to build the best they can-- both hardware and software-- within 24 hours.

### What is a Hackathon?
A Hackathon is an event in which all sorts of hackers come together to innovative projects to solve real world problems, with additional prizes for projects tailored towards sponsors. Hackademia will provide all of the mentorship and food you need to create an amazing project. You can read more [here](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601).

### Who can participate?
All high schoolers (9th-12th grade) are eligible to attend Hackademia. You can come with a team or as an individual, but we ask that all teams are limited to four people.

### What if I don’t know how to code?
You can definitely still come! Everyone has to begin somewhere. Our mentors and workshops will help you learn and develop a dream project in 24 hours.

### What if I don’t have a team or idea?
Don’t worry; there will be a matching session in the beginning of the hackathon where you can meet fellow hackers and be sorted into teams. Also, most hackers don’t have a complete idea until the beginning of the hackathon.

### What are the prizes and awards (when we get there)?
Currently, there are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place medals and finalist pins, but the awards and prizes list will expand as we gain sponsors.

### Is there a code of conduct?
Yes, it can be seen [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf). (tl;dr: Don’t be a jerk.)

### What should I bring?
It is recommended that you bring a laptop with case and or backpack, headphones, toiletries, reusable water bottle, charger, pillow and sleeping bag, and High School or Government ID. You should also bring any hardware you would like to hack on.

### Can I get a Travel Reimbursement?
Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to provide a travel reimbursement.

### What should I do if I have a question that you haven’t answered?
Just send us an email at [contact@hackademia.io](mailto:contact@hackademia.io) and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
